# SAV-MAKER-I
## Introduction

The SAV MAKER I is an “open hardware” project made in Spain and based on the popular [vinciDuino board](https://bitbucket.org/fmalpartida/vinciduino/wiki/Home), 
predecessor of Arduino's Leonardo board and fully compatible with it. 
This development has been carried out for the Telecom Engineering "Applied Electronics" course carried out in the
UMA (Universidad de Málaga). On day one, students will receive a bare PCB and a set of components to assemble and 
use it on some of their course projects.

The SAV MAKER I is an “open hardware” project, a board with an 8-bit microcontroller similar to the Arduino Leonardo
and fully compatible with it. The spirit behind it is for students to be able to build and user their own tools, 
analyse, build on and share their work.
At the end of the year, the board will be revised with their contributions, and who knows, we may use the highest rated board
on next year's course. It will be fun to see how the board evolves over the years.

Beign an open project where anyone can be part of the design team; anyone can bring knowledge, comments and ideas for 
developing other Arduino compatible training board or a programmable board using the Atmel environment without an 
external programmer. It is not limited to students. However, in comparison with other similar “open hardware” projects the 
SAV MAKER I has been designed for people to learn, build and use it while being cost effective. The cost has been optimized
as much as possible to accomodate any budget and pursue the real open hardware’s spirit.
